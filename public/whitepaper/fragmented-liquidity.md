## Fragmented Liquidity

### Multi-DEX Complexity

The **fragmentation of liquidity across various Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** within the Solana ecosystem presents another significant obstacle. Major platforms like Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, and others each maintain separate liquidity pools, making it challenging to identify the best prices and execute trades efficiently.

### Liquidity Distribution

Solana's DEX ecosystem features:

- **10+ major DEXs** with significant trading volume
- **Different AMM models** with varying price impact characteristics
- **Inconsistent token support** across platforms
- **Variable fee structures** affecting net returns
- **Separate liquidity pools** requiring individual monitoring

Monitoring multiple platforms simultaneously is a task that can be time-consuming and complex for individual traders. Without sophisticated tools for aggregating and analyzing liquidity across the ecosystem, traders may execute at suboptimal prices or miss opportunities entirely.
